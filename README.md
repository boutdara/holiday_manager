# holiday_manager

## Introduction
This is a repository containing all files pertaining to the Week 7 assessment for the Dev10 Development Program. We were tasked to develop a text-based holiday manager application for a marketing team using Python.

## File Descriptions
- The **Flowchart.png** image shows my overall plan for this project.
- **holidays.json** is the starter file that the admin has selected. It initially contained a select few holidays.
- In the **ParseJSON.py** file, I was able to parse three years worth of data tables from timeanddate.com to the **holidays.json** starter file. It is only three years instead of the specified five due to a ValueError in two of the years (2020 and 2024). 
- **holidays_updated.json** is the updated **holidays.json** file containing the parsed data. I have uploaded it here for viewing purposes. (Note: I made a minor adjustment to the brackets and indents in the JSON when the data was parsed in order to load it into the program code.) 
- The **HolidayManager.py** file contains the (largely unfinished) program code. I believe it is somewhat functional, but it is still missing some key components that make the program work in the first place. I will try finish up my work as soon as I can.
